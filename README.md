# Object-Detection-Tensorflow

- In this project, deep learning-based methodologies are used to perform object detection on construction safety workers dataset. Project objective was more inclined towards accuracy and not on speed so, for this work, Faster R-CNN was selected as the base algorithm and with that good detection results with mAP value of 64% was achieved for the hard hat workers dataset.
